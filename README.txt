FMSAlertManager is a static library that wraps the normal delegate-based API for alerts with a more conveniant block-based API. This lets us easily create a UIAlertView, and define both the buttons and the actions that will be triggered in one place.

The complete documentation can be found in FMSAlertManager/FMSAlertManager.docset. Copy this file into ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets/ and restart Xcode to add this docset to Xcode's documentation.

FMSAlertViewTest is a sample application that demonstrates the use of FMSAlertManager.

FMSAlerts.xcworspace is a workspace containing both the FMSAlertManager and FMSAlertViewTest projects.

The FMSAlertManager library is released under the Modified BSD license. If you have any questions, please contact Richard Warren at rich@freelancemadscience.com.
